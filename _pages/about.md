I am a Senior Lecturer in applied mathematics at School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Glasgow. I obtained his bachelor and master degree in applied mechanics from Fudan University, and then pursued my PhD in computational biomechanics at Brunel University. After finishing my PhD, I spent one year in University of Strathclyde on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging process, and then moved to University of Glasgow  as a research fellow working on
image-based cardiac function modelling, first on mitral valve, now focusing on ventricle. I am a key member of the SofTMech centre (http://www.softmech.org)  funded by UK EPSRC at University of Glasgow, and one of the founder of GlasgowHeart (http://www.glasgowheart.org).
