## Statistical Emulation

Data-driven Graph Nerual Network of Myocaridal Passive Mechanics (https://github.com/dodaltuin/passive-lv-gnn-emul/tree/main)
======

This is the repository accompanying the paper "Emulation of Cardiac Mechanics using Graph Neural Networks", in which the Graph Neural Network is used to emulate left ventricular passive filling.
